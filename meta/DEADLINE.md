## Part 1: App Description

> My app is the classic arcade game, Space Invaders.
> The game consists of the player, which is a spaceship at the bottom, and aliens.
> The player can move to the left and right using the arrow keys, and can shoot missiles using the spacebar.
> The first level consists of 40 aliens in a grid that move with each other. They move left and right, and
> down only once an alien hits the side wall. They speed up in movement as they are killed by the player, and they also shoot
> missiles at the player. If the player is hit, he loses one life. The game is lost if the player loses all 4 lives,
> or if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen.
> The second level is a boss which has many lives, and must be shot many times before he dies. The boss shoots
> large missiles down at the player and has a random movement pattern.
> The losing condition is the same as level 1.
> If the boss is killed, the game is won.
> Get a high score by killing as many aliens as possible and saving your lives.

## Part 2: New

> It was exciting to create my first game with graphics and frames. Making movement is
> very exciting.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If I could start over from scratch, I think I would try to make my MyGame update method shorter by splitting it into methods.
> My update method came out to about 130 lines at first since it included a lot of repeated code for level 1 and 2 that was only slightly changed,
> so I could have probably made a method that would intake parameters depending on which level it was and then act accordingly.
> Overall, there is some simplification that could have been done if I started from scratch, but my code still felt pretty organized.
